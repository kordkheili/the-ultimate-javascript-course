# Challenge #2 (Day of Week)

Write a function that takes a date as input and returns the day of the week in Persian as output, like شنبه, یکشنبه ... جمعه

Here are some additional details that may be helpful:

- The function should take a single argument, which is a Date object.
- The function should return a string that represents the day of the week in Persian.

Here is an example of how the function should be used:

```js
const date = new Date();
const dayName = getDayName(date);
console.log(dayName); // Output: "شنبه"
```
