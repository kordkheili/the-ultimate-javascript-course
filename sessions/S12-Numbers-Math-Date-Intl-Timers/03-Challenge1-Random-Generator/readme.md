# Challenge #1 (Random Generator)

Write a function that takes two arguments, a minimum value and a maximum value, and returns a random number between those two values.

Here are some additional details that may be helpful:

- The function should take two arguments, both of which are numbers.
- The function should return a number that is greater than or equal to the minimum value and less than or equal to the maximum value.
- The function should use the ‍‍‍`Math.random()` function to generate the random number.

Here is an example of how the function should be used:

```js
const min = 1;
const max = 10;
const randomNumber = getRandomNumber(min, max);
console.log(randomNumber); // Output: a random number between 1 and 10
```
